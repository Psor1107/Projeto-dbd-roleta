Her parents had separated when she was still a baby, mainly since her mother was often away filming. Jane was raised by her father, a struggling visual artist. She grew up torn between resenting her mother's absence from her life and admiring her presence on screen.\nAs a teenager, Jane secretly wished to emulate her mother's talent. She would direct and perform in plays, audition for TV commercials and help her father at his studio. During her senior year, she entered a national oratory contest and won first prize. Her performance attracted the attention of a radio station that contacted her for an interview. During the live show, her natural charm and repartee impressed the staff, who offered her a part-time job at the station.\nAfter graduating college in Communication, she quit her job at the station to work for a trendy variety show. But her frank delivery and ad-libs were not appreciated by the show's executives, who fired her after five months. Desperate for another opportunity, Jane pitched a show at the radio station she used to work at, only to be turned down, her proposal being too risky.\nFour months later, she received a phone call from a producer who had seen reruns of the show. He was looking for a co-host to spark up the failing show Quick Talk.\nLive television meant long hours, a low salary, and no stability, but it also offered a platform to broadcast her views. She disputed the crude inflammatory tone of Quick Talk and pushed for a relate-able coverage of personal issues. Her honest delivery resonated with her audience and within weeks, the show's viewer-ship was steadily growing.\nAfter two years, she launched a full-hour segment called The Jane Romero Show, which was broadcast nationally and covered tabooed topics, including her personal struggle with abandonment. Her show broke records and her initials J. R. became synonymous with products ranging from beauty creams to fashion accessories.\nBut Jane needed more; she wanted others to follow her in her footsteps. She published a memoir that covered her childhood with an absent mother. Her book was an instant best seller, but was reviewed harshly. Critics called it \"a serving of sad anecdotes seasoned with bland, generic self-help tips.\" Jane took this criticism to heart, since despite her success, a voice in the back of her mind was starting to doubt her achievements. Her success also generated an increasingly demanding schedule and a growing pressure to entertain constantly. During a particularly tense week, she canned an episode and instead launched a two-hour-long special on divorce. Her stress peaked when she learnt that her mother had agreed to star in her show.\nJane put on a brave face and began the show. Most of it went without a hitch, but her mother walked on set, smiling warmly at the audience, Jane's stomach lurched unpleasantly. She was consumed by a violent envy that had been festering. Yet she carried on with a strained smile, until Loretta interrupted her, saying that they were not actually related. The interview went haywire after that.\nAfter the show, Jane was driving to her father's house in New Jersey. She needed to talk things over with him; she had not been feeling like herself lately. She turned on a free-way along the coast to avoid major congestion and popped some painkillers to numb the throbbing pain in her temples, which had been nagging her all day. Then she started to relax and turned on the radio; classical music was playing. The drive was slow. Black ice covered the highway, which was packed with cars on their way back home. Night fell. A darkness began to blur the corners of her vision and turned the headlights into swirls of red. Jane blinked to sharpen their outlines, but each time she closed her eyes, her eyelids became heavier and heavier, until they remained shut for a moment too long.\nThe following morning, authorities were fishing out Jane's car from the water. Despite leading a meticulous search for weeks, they were unable to retrieve her body.\nThe airing and production of The Jane Romero Show was suspended until after her funeral, which both her father and mother attended.\nAs the public grieved for Jane, there was a surge of orders for J. R. products and all her episodes were re-released a month later, with an opening credit that wished her eternal peace.\n", "row": 4, "column": 4}, {"name": "Ash Williams", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/AshWilliams.png", "overview": "Ash Williams is an alone wolf, cocky and headstrong; a man built for survival.\nHis personal Perks, Flip-Flop, Buckle Up, and Mettle of Man, give him additional resilience to pain and hardship, as well as the ability to help his friends out of sticky situations.\n", "row": 5, "column": 1}, {"name": "Nancy Wheeler", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/NancyWheeler.png", "overview": "Nancy Wheeler is an aspiring journalist, able to make acute observations and gain insights that others may miss.\nHer personal Perks, Better Together, Fixated, and Inner Strength, give her the information and courage she needs to tackle unexpected challenges.\n", "row": 5, "column": 2}, {"name": "Steve Harrington", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/SteveHarrington.png", "overview": "Steve Harrington is a former jock, able to protect and support his fellow Survivors while providing his own brand of humour.\nHis personal Perks, Babysitter, Camaraderie, and Second Wind, enable him to distract Killers, tolerate pain, and get back into the fight.\n", "row": 5, "column": 3}, {"name": "Yui Kimura", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/YuiKimura.png", "overview": "Yui Kimura is a hardened street racer, able to gain advantages for her and her fellow Survivors in challenging situations.\nHer personal Perks, Lucky Break, Any Means Necessary, and Breakout, enable her to cover her blood trails, reset dropped Pallets, and assist helpless Survivors.\n", "row": 5, "column": 4}, {"name": "Zarina Kassir", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/ZarinaKassir.png", "overview": "Zarina Kassir is a plucky documentarian, able to use her street smarts to avoid detection and greatly assist other Survivors.\nHer personal Perks, Off the Record, Red Herring, and For the People, help her remain hidden in the face of danger, create distractions, and quickly heal others by forgoing her own safety.\n", "row": 6, "column": 1}, {"name": "Cheryl Mason", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/CherylMason.png", "overview": "Cheryl Mason is a young Veteran of Terror, emboldening both herself and her team.\nHer personal Perks, Soul Guard, Blood Pact, and Repressed Alliance, allow her to survive through immense hardship, stay in contact with team members, and plan objectives.\nCaring and impulsive, Cheryl Mason, previously known as Heather, attempted to rebuild her life after the tragic death of her adoptive father, Harry Mason.\nWhile she had freed herself from the religious cult that pursued her since birth, she was shackled by the guilt of her father's death.

His parents, both members of an ancient society, were always out of the Richter manor at medical conferences or providing humanitarian aid around the world. Travelling exposed young Felix to new cultures, languages, and architecture unlike anything he had ever seen before. He wasn't sure when the architectural bug bit, but when it did, it bit hard, and he knew that despite his family's legacy, he would one day design buildings that would inspire the world. By 23, he was considered an architectural prodigy having won the Swiss Architect Medal and the German National Design Award. Yet despite his success, Felix couldn't shake the gnawing feeling that his success had more to do with luck and connections than talent and hard work.\nGrowing up, Felix was socially awkward and introverted, preferring his imagination to the company of others. He had few friends so when he wasn't travelling with his parents, Felix was in his father's library devouring rare books, studying history and architecture, soaking up anything and everything he could on architectural movements throughout the centuries.  His father hoped young Felix would learn to be more outgoing and hired every possible specialist to help improve his social skills. When these efforts failed, he threw in the proverbial towel and figured his son would learn when he was ready. He then joined young Felix in the library, where he helped him build elaborate wooden models of buildings while telling him wild stories about his secret club and their ancient battle against a dark and ominous force. Stories, Felix was sure, his father had made up to make his 'Imperiatti' group sound cooler than it actually was.\nFelix sometimes wondered if his design sensibilities came from his summer trips to Dyer Island, a private island that boasted some of the world's finest homes and designs. Every summer, Felix would accompany his parents to the island, where members of The Imperiatti would encourage their children to network and forge lifelong connections. Felix didn't mingle well with the other teenagers, but he did make four friends who like himself didn't quite fit the 'high-society' mould. They were often ridiculed by other teens and disparagingly called 'The Pariahs', a name they liked and gladly adopted. Instead of practising public speaking and engaging in endless debates, The Pariahs spent most of their time exploring the ruins and mysteries of the island until one of their adventures took a turn for the worse.\nExploring an abandoned internment camp, they descended into what seemed to be an underground laboratory where they uncovered old, leather journals with illustrations and notes of inhumane experiments conducted on prisoners of the First Opium War held by the British East India Company. As they pushed through a locked door, they found a chamber scattered with human skeletons and dusty vials filled with an unknown serum. Before they could examine the contents, the ground seemed to shake beneath their feet and a hissing sound filled their ears. A strange fog suddenly appeared and giant claws seemed to burst from the ground as dark imagination mingled with reality to terrorise them. Before they understood what was happening, Felix's father and several other parents came to their rescue, using strange tools and objects to protect them. Felix stared at the scene in shock and disbelief. He wasn't sure if he was dreaming or living one of his father's ridiculous, supernatural stories. By the time he realised it wasn't a dream, it was all over. The Pariahs were safe, but their parents had mysteriously disappeared without a trace.\nAfter the shock of his father's disappearance, Felix searched for any theory that could help him understand the phenomena he had encountered on the island. He exchanged notes with The Pariahs and other people he had met online who had also lost loved ones in a similar way. The tragedy had fostered a strong relationship between The Pariahs and for years they worked together to unravel the mystery of what had happened to their parents. But nothing made sense, and every lead they pursued hit a dead end. With time their efforts dwindled, and the five friends slowly grew apart, each going their separate ways, hoping to forget the nameless darkness that had robbed them of their parents.\nOver the years, Felix proved to be an exceptional architect, though he found little inspiration working for others. He realised his father was right. His lack of social skills was holding him back. With dedication and purpose, he improved his diction and decorum and learned how to network or 'play-act' as he liked to call it. He created the perfect fa\u00e7ade to make himself more likeable and popular with potential clients. After working for several architectural firms, he established his firm with his colleague Lauren Golder. Both shared a similar vision and were philosophically opposed to formulaic modernist buildings, often experimenting with unusual materials, shapes and structures.\nFelix continued to undermine traditional expectations in favour of the edgy and unconventional devices that set the architectural world abuzz. But even with all the accolades, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was a phony, like an actor who had learned a part instead of a true architect who had inspired the world with an impeccable design. During these moments of insecurity and self-doubt, he would distract himself with endless parties and drown his anxieties in alcohol, wishing his father was still around for some harsh advice and tempered wisdom.\nEventually, Felix's girlfriend announced that he was going to be a father. The news shook him to the core and, wanting to inspire his unborn child as much as his father inspired him, he quickly pulled his life together. What he needed was a project that would challenge him and cement his worth as an architect. As fate would have it, the perfect opportunity presented itself when old friends of his father commissioned his firm 'Richter and Golder' to build something new and unconventional on Dyer Island. The challenge excited and terrified Felix, who now drowned his anxieties with articles and books on parenting.\nWithin six months, the Dyer Restoration Project was underway, and as Felix surveyed the island, he suddenly heard a familiar voice calling out to him from beyond the shattered Victorian buildings and the crumbling ruins hiding dark stories long hidden and forgotten. Through a strange, gathering fog, he saw a form slowly take shape. His eyes widened, and his lips parted, but no words issued forth. Could it be? Was it possible? No... it couldn't be... it was... impossible... and yet...\nWith dawning realisation, Felix staggered back as he watched his father emerge from the fog. His legs felt weak, and his rising heartbeat thrashed in his ears. It was him. It was really him. His unborn child would know his grandfather, and he could finally show him how much he had accomplished since he disappeared. They stared at one another for a long moment. Then his father gave him a look of disappointment, turned his back on him, and proceeded to walk away. Over his pounding heart, Felix chased after him and was never seen again.\n", "row": 6, "column": 3}, {"name": "\u00c9lodie Rakoto", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/ElodieRakoto.png", "overview": "\u00c9lodie Rakoto is an occult investigator, able to use cunning tricks and stubborn resolve to keep herself alive.\nHer personal Perks, Appraisal, Deception, and Power Struggle, allow her to interact with objects in new ways, all while having a backup plan to escape Killers.\n", "row": 6, "column": 4}, {"name": "Yun-Jin Lee", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/Yun-JinLee.png", "overview": "Yun-Jin Lee is a self-interested music producer, able to advance her goals during turbulent times.\nHer personal Perks, Fast Track, Smash Hit, and Self-Preservation, allow her to improve her abilities when others are harmed, and quickly escape from a chase.\nResilient and ambitious, Yun-Jin was born into a life of hardship finding success in the music industry after years of effort and self-sacrifice.\nAs a child Yun-Jin was fascinated by sound, mimicking drums, and hitting keys on the piano. When she turned ten, however, she lost her instruments. Her family was heavily in debt and did not make the payments in time. The creditors took everything they owned, including the house. Yun-Jin held her four-year-old sister tightly as she cried. They moved into a windowless, two-bedroom basement. Since her parents worked day and night to pay their debt, Yun-Jin became her sister's caretaker. Every night she sang until they both fell asleep.\nAt seventeen, the renowned record label Mightee One Entertainment came to her high school to audition talent.  She was rejected as an idol trainee but obtained an unpaid internship at the studio. For the following years, she created some of the studio's biggest hits, without any credit or recognition. To get her dues, she emerged in the public eye wearing flamboyant fashion and put soundbites into her songs that looped her artist name, Magnum Opus. Fans began to recognize her songs and she became the producer of NO SPIN, a poorly performing boy band who needed her special touch.\nDissatisfied with NO SPIN's commercial sound, she sought a rogue element to make the band stand out. Through her contacts in talent shows she found the edgy, raw sound of Ji-Woon Hak. She re-launched NO SPIN with Ji-Woon as its newest member. Within hours their first video was a viral sensation.\nTheir success cemented Yun-Jin\u2019s reputation as a shrewd producer. Adorned in high fashion to attend luxurious events, Yun-Jin's harsh, impoverished childhood seemed far behind her. She moved into a penthouse and dined with socialites in skyline restaurants with breath-taking views of Seoul.\nThe success of the first album broke records, setting the bar high for NO SPIN's second. As they were recording new tracks, the fire alarm suddenly blared. Concerned for her safety, Yun-Jin hurried to evacuate the building and left the dallying staff behind. Only when she bolted out into the street that she realized NO SPIN was nowhere amongst the coughing crowd. A goliath of flames engulfed the building, slowly tamed by the steady streams of fire hoses.\nAll members of NO SPIN perished in the fire except one: Ji-Woon. The album was ruined. The band was over. She would be shelved while Ji-Woon would rot away as an instructor for idol trainees. But she refused to be a victim who watched helplessly as vultures swooped in to take what was hers.\nUnknown to Mightee One Entertainment, she created new tracks to re-launch Ji-Woon's career. She pushed him to tap into his grief and create a song exploring the pangs of sudden loss. The music video showed Ji-Woon saying goodbye to each member of NO SPIN. Yun-Jin cleverly launched the song under Ji-Woon's newly adopted stage name: The Trickster. He would embody both fear and awe like the legendary dokkaebi spirits.\nJi-Woon's song was a global phenomenon, its universal themes of grief and guilt resonating internationally. Together, Yun-Jin and The Trickster toured the world. Success greeted them on every shore. Yet disturbingly, so did a series of eccentric murders. This connection unsettled Yun-Jin as she noticed that the tour dates coincided with the victims' time of death. She was weary after the loss of NO SPIN and anxious to preserve her artist, so she increased the Trickster's security detail. What if the serial killer was an unhinged fan fixated on the Trickster, inspired by the artist's morbid songs?\nReturning to Seoul, Yun-Jin worked with Ji-Woon on his new material. When she entered the studio at the brink of dawn, she was surprised to see Ji-Woon already there. He seemed exhausted, like he had worked all night. When she listened to his track, she discovered a bizarre intro filled with shrieks and snares. It was too experimental for her taste.\nA week later, another death was reported. The body showed traces of torture and was arranged in the same flamboyant style as previous murders, this time diamond Cufflinks gouged into the eyes victim's eyes. The following day, the victim was on every television channel. A video from the victim's social media showed her squealing, surprised when her boyfriend handed her a heart-shaped, birthday cake. Yun-Jin's stomach churned. That voice. So familiar. And yet, she had never met the victim.\nThe next morning, her heart froze when she listened to the Trickster's opening track. The shrieks in his song matched the victim's squeal. Did he sample the victim's birthday video? No, that was impossible: he had recorded this song before the murder was reported. She stared at Ji-Woon on the other side of the booth's glass window. He was NO SPIN's only survivor. Everyone else was dead. Not to mention the eccentric murders that matched his tour dates. Death trails that seemed to converge... to him.\nIf he caused... this, no artist would survive the scandal. Yun-Jin's career, no, her life would be over. All she had would be destroyed. A wave of nausea surged over her. Heart racing, she rushed to the restroom. Wild thoughts blazed through her mind as she splashed icy water over her face. There had to be a simpler explanation. Perhaps she was overworked. Or maybe, she did not trust her success. Her mind was fabricating this suspicion because disaster was easier to trust than success. It was all in her head. She returned to the recording booth, eager to put her worries behind her.\nMonths later, pressure came from Mightee One Entertainment executives. Revenue was down and they blamed the Trickster since they disapproved the violent themes in his music and the knife tricks he pulled during performances. While Yun-Jin was furious they scapegoated her artist, she agreed that Ji-Woon's sound was too niche to generate profit. She told Ji-Woon she fought them off but was ultimately outnumbered. Because of her initial fury, he believed her to be on his side. They were given three months to create and perform the next hit for Mightee One.\nMonths flew by and the time came for Yun-Jin to take a seat at the executives' private show. She was confident about her song but as soon as the music started, she knew something was amiss.Dense, foul smoke permeated the room. Yun-Jin coughed and gasped for air. But the more she coughed, the more she inhaled. Her body sank in the chair, her limbs heavy and numb, and her eyes widened as she watched, terrified, a nightmare come to life.\nThe Trickster was a whirlwind of blood, slashing, stabbing, and chopping limbs. The executives were carved up like meat. They could not run. They were stuck, like Yun-Jin, paralysed. A boiling rage swelled in her gut. How could she have denied her instincts? The fire. The murders on tour. It was him. It had always been him. And she had known from the start. Now her career was over, and so was Mightee One. Everyone she had worked with, her colleagues, her friends, dying before her eyes. Everything she had, taken from her once more.\nNo, she would not let him. He would pay. He would know her suffering.

She would always miss his sailing lessons at dawn, his colourful yet inedible tacos, and his warm, contagious laughter. She felt like she was paddling in a vast, storm-black ocean, each rolling wave submerging her. Drifting in painful darkness, she almost lost herself, but resiliently, with love and care, she made her way back to shore.\nWell-surrounded and supported by her friends, Mikaela put the past behind her and looked at life in a new light. She was excited to try new things and discovered storytelling as an outlet. Her friends liked her stories of daunting danger and hard-earned survival. She read horror stories more and more, savouring the powerful, heart-pounding escapism it provided. Autumn become her favourite season and she threw a grand production for Halloween every year, hosting all her friends for a thrilling night of horror stories, scary games, and homemade treats.\nOver the years, she also showed interest in witchcraft and practiced light blessings, plant-based spells, and palm-reading divination. She gardened sage, mugwort, and lavender to craft homemade products such as body butters, soaps and skin lotions. She aspired one day to live off the products she made for friends and family.\nIn the meantime, she worked as a barista at the Moonstone, an independent and eccentric coffee shop in the artsy part of town, Every Friday night, she hosted an open mic at the coffee shop, performing stories live in front of customers. Julian, her best friends and roommate, recorded some of her shows and posted them online. Also, unbeknown to her, he submitted one of her performances to the Endless Halloween Festival where renown storytellers performed on stage for Halloween.\nIt was a beautiful surprise when Mikaela received an email from the festival inviting her to perform at their grand final on Halloween. The winning prize was big enough for her to launch her line of products. Excited, she burnt a stick of herbs in each room to dissipate negative energies, then began to craft her tale of horror.\nMikaela stayed up all night filling her notebooks with abandoned beginnings. She had a story in mind, but unearthing it took patience and skill. The following night, the nightmares began. For a week, she would wake in the middle of the night gasping for air. Her dream was the same every night. She was dragged down a cold set of stairs and thrown into a dark basement. Then her lungs would be set ablaze by a sharp iron hook stabbing her in the chest. A dark figure would pull on the hook and hoist her from the ground, slowly, until the pain waked her. The more she finessed her Halloween tale, the darker her nightmares grew.\nAs days passed, exhaustion, anxiety, and stress took a toll on her. Often distracted, her coffees at the Moonstone were rushed, acrid, or going to the wrong customer. She no longer blessed the coffee beans in the morning nor looked for omens in the leftover coffee grains. Her energy was low, and her magic felt drained.\nWhen she woke up screaming one night, she had had enough. She asked Julian to watch her while she slept and record anything unusual. Julian agreed and started recording while Mikaela lay on her bed.\nMinutes later, her fingers began to twitch, then her toes. Her breath became laboured. Then Julian stared in shock as Mikaela slowly rose in the air, levitating over her bed. Panicked, he shook her shoulders to wake her, but stopped when she began to scream. He grabbed his phone to call an ambulance, but a powerful crash diverted his attention. He looked down the hallway and saw a large, spidery fang slam through the bathroom door.\nAmidst the commotion, Mikaela woke. She saw the black spidery fang shredding the bathroom door and jumped out of bed. She slammed her bedroom door shut and shouted at Julian to help her barricade the door. Before he could react, however, the power went out. The room was submerged in sudden darkness.\nA second later, the lights came back on and an eerie quietness followed. Mikaela and Julian ventured out the bedroom carefully. The bathroom door looked intact and there was no sign of anything abnormal. But Julian has recorded every sound.\nA sleepless night followed. When she returned to the apartment after her shift, Julian was not there. Mikaela wanted to remove the recording of their ordeal, which he had posted online. Suspecting Julian might be at school, she left. The door clicked shut behind her, masking a stifled cry from the bathroom.\nAs she neared her car, she looked over her shoulder. Mikaela felt... watched. She whispered a protective spell and clutched her keys. Suddenly, a shadow pounced on the wall and she broke into a run. She reached her car and rushed inside, locking the doors. Breathing hard, she looked through the windows. No one was there. Perhaps it was her nerves playing tricks on her. She turned on the ignition and drove off.\nThe next day, Julian was still nowhere to be found. Mikaela had contacted everyone they knew. She looked for him all day and waited for him all night. Distraught and anxious, she missed her shift at the Moonstone. Halloween was tonight and so was the festival. Julian had entered the storytelling competition for her. He had supported her every time she doubted herself. Maybe he would be there. But between her nightmares and Julian's disappearance, she had been too worried to prepare a story for the contest. She looked at her notebook, filled with false starts. She could stay home, scared and helpless. Or she could finish what Julian had started. There was a reason why she loved to tell horror stories. They made her feel brave enough to face any challenge.\nThat evening when the host called Mikaela's name at the Endless Halloween Festival, she boldly stepped on stage, dressed in a costume: a black dress matched with a wide, witchy hat. She hoped to spot Julian in the crowd. But she could not find him and looking directly at the audience was a mistake. A sea of expectant faces was before her, eyes watching her every move. Her heart pounded in her chest as her hands began to shake.\nShe grabbed the warm microphone and cleared her throat. A thick silence greeted her, only interrupted by a distant cough. She reminded herself that tonight was All Hallows' Eve, when the veil thinned betwixt this realm and the one beyond. She had a story in her heart, a story that mattered. If she told it right, perhaps Julian would hear it.\nMikaela took a deep breath. The wet wind of Autumn whirled golden leaves around her. She inhaled the acrid smell of damp, foliage. She swallowed the bitter aftertaste of coffee still on her tongue. Distant eyes cawed from an old oak tree. She closed her eyes. The crimson darkness under her eyelids turned darker. Her heartbeat slowed. She exhaled deeply, her breath a puff of mist in the cold night air. Now she felt awakened, refreshed for the first time in weeks, and ready to tell the tale of a lifetime.\nShe spoke into the microphone in a deep, haunting voice. She narrated a tale of billowing winds on a cold Autumn night. Of a loyal friend disappearing before daylight. Of forgotten victims hiding in the wings of darkness. Of throbbing graves, sealed with terrible secrets. And of eternal night in the shadow of death.\nMikaela pointed at the night sky and said that no darkness was truly beyond light. Even on this moonless night, the sky shined with long-dead stars.\nA thick black fog engulfed Mikaela, to the audience's amazement.\nAnd no one saw Mikaela Reid again.\n", "row": 7, "column": 4}, {"name": "Jonah Vasquez", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/JonahVasquez.png", "overview": "Jonah Vasquez is a mathematical mastermind, able to use logic to help his team.\nHis personal Perks, Overcome, Corrective Action, and Boon: Exponential, allow him to quickly flee, correct failed Skill Checks, and treat dying Survivors.\n", "row": 8, "column": 1}, {"name": "Yoichi Asakawa", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/YoichiAsakawa.png", "overview": "Yoichi Asakawa is a brilliant marine biologist and psychic whose knowledge and abilities allow him to protect himself and assist others.\nHis personal Perks, Parental Guidance, Empathic Connection, and Boon: Dark Theory, allow him to hide from Killers, call out to injured Survivors, and help others move faster.\nAs a child, Yoichi gained an interest in the supernatural from his father and mother when an inexplicable curse claimed both their lives. As an adult, Yoichi graduated with top honours in marine biology from a university in Tokyo, and, following in his father\u2019s footsteps, became the youngest professor in the school\u2019s history. But his career began to unravel when two of his students disappeared while doing research in Izu Oshima. The mere mention of Izu Oshima triggered painful memories from his past. Deep, hidden memories bubbled up from the murky, black depths of his subconscious. Blurred faces on images, twisted mouths, inexplicable deaths suddenly filled his mind. The shouts of people calling him a monster. And then\u2026 the monster\u2026 Sadako rose from the abyss to let him know the curse was not over. It would never be over.\nWith a cry, Yoichi shut his eyes and slowly released his fear. When he opened his eyes again, Sadako was gone, but something had returned. Something ominous and otherworldly. He could feel an unnerving presence near him, breathing deeply like the heaving sea. Was Sadako tormenting him? Was a spirit trying to warn him? Or was it something else? Something that consumed people. Something that made people disappear. Yoichi wasn\u2019t sure. He had spent his life trying to understand his psychic abilities and the supernatural. His instincts told him the answers somehow lay with water. He had, after all, dedicated his life to studying intelligent life and unexplored realms within the ocean. Perhaps he needed to readjust his definition of intelligent. Or his definition of life.\nThirsting for truth, Yoichi entered a frenzy of research into the fringes of parapsychology, cryptozoology, theology, folk history. The more he expanded his field of expertise, the more he was ridiculed and ostracized. Once viewed as a brilliant young mind, Yoichi was now considered an eccentric and a liability. In mere months, the university terminated his position. Undeterred, Yoichi sought professorships at other schools, but no reputable college in Japan would take him. As a last resort he approached media outlets, and by some twist of fate, the company where his mother had worked at as a journalist offered to fund his research in exchange for articles and first publishing rights to his story.\nDuring this difficult time, Yoichi's father returned to him\u2014his spirit silently goading him to continue the course he had chosen. And so, working around the clock in his tiny Tokyo apartment, he allied himself with other researchers in the paranormal field. Within months, he came across a story that mirrored the disappearances of his students: four vloggers had mysteriously disappeared near a lighthouse in Scotland.  With a great sense of urgency, Yoichi took the first flight he could to Glasgow. A professor at a local university had come to many of the same conclusions as he had nearly seventy years earlier when a film crew disappeared near the very same lighthouse. There was some kind of intelligence in the water\u2014some kind of darkness calling from the sea like an ancient siren. As Yoichi examined the research, his father suddenly appeared to let him know he was on the right path.\nGuided by his father, Yoichi chartered a fishing boat and headed toward a small cluster of islands known as the Seven Hunters. Darkness fell as they approached the isles. The lighthouse, now automated and controlled remotely, sputtered and winked out of existence like a dying star. The ocean began to stir violently, lightning flashed, and the fisherman begged Yoichi to turn back, but Yoichi refused. He was too close and would not be deterred. As they argued the ocean raged and tossed the ship high and low. Then one giant wave lifted the boat as high as a house and dashed it to pieces against dark, jagged rocks.\nYoichi didn\u2019t remember much after that. He remembered falling into the water. He remembered swimming to the landing where he saw his father standing on the gallery of the lighthouse beckoning him. He remembered staggering through thick black fog as he climbed the stairs. He remembered the water level rising with every step until the frothing mouth of the raging ocean swallowed him whole.\n", "row": 8, "column": 2}, {"name": "Haddie Kaur", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/HaddieKaur.png", "overview": "Haddie Kaur is a brave and determined podcaster with the ability to see and feel places of great suffering she calls Overlaps.\nHer personal Perks, Inner Focus, Residual Manifest, and Overzealous, allow her to track Survivors and Killers after an attack, use Flashlights more effectively, and repair Generators more efficiently.\nPrior to her addition as a playable Character, Haddie Kaur was only known to be an Indian psychic investigator mentioned in several Tome entries.She created the Harbinger of Hell web-series, where she investigated paranormal phenomena and historical tragedies, as well as working to expose The Black Vale across various realities.She made the web series alongside her older French-Canadian step-brother, Jordan Rois, and it was produced by her step-uncle, Stefan Rois.She was funded by a mysterious benefactor, Surin Rivera.\nShe had the ability to see what others cannot, and view the Overlaps between realities, as well as the events of the past.\nHaddie spent her youth in a household brimming with love. Her mother, Professor Basant Kaur, moved across the world to teach agricultural science at a university in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec. Her father, Rajan Singh, found remarkable success with a catering business in the small, Quebecoise town. Her house constantly swirled with the wonderful aromas of cumin, chillies, masala, cardamom and fresh, steaming naan pulled from a tandoor oven. Her earliest memories were filled with stories of India and on her tenth birthday her parents promised to visit Punjab just after the new year.\nDuring the holiday season, her parents went to a party with their closest friends, Marise and Francois Rois. When Haddie called her parents to say she felt sick, they left in a hurry. Driving through the winding, snow-swept roads of rural Quebec, Rajan lost control of the car, skidding into an icy, gnarled forest. It would be two days before their bodies were found trapped in the vehicle. As Haddie's fever broke, the police arrived at her doorstep telling her that they had not suffered. But Haddie was old enough to know the police were just being kind. The next morning, she woke up with white hair and a question that would haunt her for the rest of her life.\nThe Rois took Haddie in, doing their best to fill the hole left by her parents. Despite the enormous loss, Haddie was again surrounded with love: the love her adoptive parents had for their son, Jordan, and the love the three had for her. But the trauma of losing her parents seemed to unlock something within her. She began to see things nobody else could see; horrible, unnatural, unexplainable things. Apparitions tormented her in class, at home, in bed. Her unexpected screams earned her the nickname \u201cHelly Haddie\u201d, only adding to her alienation and anguish. Once a cheerful and social child, Haddie walled herself off to the world.\nWith time Haddie realised her uncanny abilities only triggered in certain areas \u2014 dark areas. It was as though there were places in the world where another dimension somehow bled into our own. Jordan called these intersecting areas Overlaps, and they seemed to give Haddie insight into a dark, shadowy world straight out of a cosmic horror story. When Haddie graduated from high school, she felt an unexplainable tug to discover who her parents were. To raise money for a trip to India, her brother Jordan suggested that they use her abilities to explore and document all the haunted places in Quebec, starting with a haunted asylum. At the Dorea Institute, Haddie could see and hear residual memories... patients, doctors, and so much more.\nWhile recording her impressions at the institute, she offhandedly called the encroaching dimension the Ravage since it not only assaulted her with memories from all times and places but also gave the sense of feeding off psychic energy. The Ravage, she sensed, was a living mosaic of human suffering that was slowly corrupting and devouring the world. She concluded that they needed to investigate more to see if there was anything to her hypothesis.\nJordan presented the footage and recordings to their uncle Stefan who helped them turn what they had documented into a web series. Within days of uploading the first episode, Ravages of the Abyss was a viral hit. True crime fans, ghost-chasers, and sceptics flooded the comments with their own theories of what she was experiencing. Stefan handled the production, and before long, he presented Haddie with her first cheque as a professional podcaster.\nNow with a working budget, Haddie was able to investigate the most haunted places in the world seeking answers about the Ravage. Her investigations led her to a secluded island where once an entire town had mysteriously disappeared leaving dozens of empty homes. She never felt such a strong influence of the Ravage as she did here. It pulsed with suffering and cruelty and repressed darkness.\nHaddie absorbed the emotions of the ghost town and closed her eyes. Calming herself and silencing her mind, she began to hear guttural screams and cries and whimpers. When she opened her eyes again, she could see the scintillating orange residual memories of people tearing each other apart in the mud and rain. Then everything disappeared as a much older version of her stepbrother beckoned her from one of the homes. \u00a0She chased after him only to stop suddenly with the realisation that the Ravage was toying with her emotions, playing tricks on her, making her see things that couldn\u2019t possibly be real.\nThe encounter nearly put Haddie off the project entirely, but she was now the linchpin for a company that fed her family. Her uncle Stefan continued to line up sites to visit, and after a personal trip backpacking across India, Haddie carried on subjecting herself to the horrors of the Ravage.\nThen, while investigating a haunted World War II bunker in the Alps, Haddie heard someone faintly crying out for help in Punjabi. Snow flurried in the bunker as a tunnel suddenly opened to a snow-covered forest. A horn blared in the distance and faded away. She saw the glow of red lights through a wall of snow and felt her heart skip a beat as she rushed to a crumpled, blue car pinned between two massive pine trees. Through the shattered windshield she saw the bodies of her parents stuck in pools of frozen blood.\nHaddie narrowed her gaze and saw tiny plumes of vapor floating from their trembling blue lips. With a profound sense of urgency, she rushed around the wreck trying her best to push, pull, and kick her way in. All to no avail. As she cried out to them that she was sorry for being sick, that the accident was all her fault, their eyes snapped open and, in unison, they answered the question that had anchored her life to their death. \"Yes... Beti... we suffered...\"\nWith a terrible cry Haddie fell back into the snow as ice tendrils wrapped around her and pulled her down into a world of endless darkness.\nHaddie Kaur is featured in multiple Tome entries in the The Archives, where her adventures are followed by The Observer.\nIn Tome 6:\nShe ventures to India to investigate a massacre of British Soldiers in the 1800s, in a cave called the Valley of Evil Eyes.In the cave, she fights a grotesque monster with dozens of red-eyes and a mouth of needle-like teeth and discovers a column piece which was hidden by a group of cloaked figures.\nIn Tome 7:She journeys to Turkey and finds a casket marked with a half-crescent and three dots.There, the casket is forcefully opened by a woman working for a secret society.Once opened, a black mist is released which possesses the women and turns them into a vampire.She manages to kill the vampire by drawing the half-crescent and three dots seal onto its face.\nIn Tome 8:\nShe travels to New York to discover who her benefactor is.There she learns of a government conspiracy to use the overlap between realities for their own ends.Her benefactor states that he instead wishes to use the overlap for scientific endeavours.\nIn Tome 10:\nShe appears again, 40 years older and more wearied.Her brother had disappeared in the Alps while recovering WW2 Nazi \"Wunder Weapons\" that were being delivered to the Thule Society.She attempts to recruit Maxwell Holt, a former soldier with similar abilities, whose unit disappeared in Afghanistan, into helping her save people from The Black Vale and The Entity.\nIn Tome 12:\nTBA.\n", "row": 8, "column": 3}, {"name": "Ada Wong", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/AdaWong.png", "overview": "Ada Wong is a mysterious secret agent whose skill in espionage makes her a dangerous foe.\nHer personal Perks, Wiretap, Reactive Healing, and Low Profile, allow her to spy on a Killer, gain a surge of healing when her allies are hurt, and leave no trace when the becoming the final Survivor.\nEverything about Ada Wong was an enigma.

At age fifteen, his father sent him to train with Ettore Fabrizio, the same knight who trained his older brothers in the military arts. But Vittorio didn\u2019t take to combat training the way his brothers did. As a student of philosophy, he believed physical violence to be the last refuge of the incompetent.\nInfuriated by Vittorio\u2019s pacifism, Fabrizio ordered one of his pages to attack him. Vittorio dodged and blocked the blows, but refused to fight back. When his enraged opponent lunged, Vittorio parried. His attacker tripped, falling on his own dagger. He bled out in less than a minute and Vittorio threw down his sword, swearing never to pick it up again.\nSince Vittorio demonstrated an aptitude for scholarship, his frustrated father sent him to study with his Uncle Renzo. Besides being the Duke of Portoscuro, Renzo was also a scholar and collector of rare artefacts.\nUnder Renzo\u2019s tutelage, Vittorio focused his studies on lost civilizations and ancient history. He researched forgotten tomes and became an expert on the philosophy and wisdom of ancient secret societies and obscure guardians of knowledge. Guardians present in almost every century and culture. Guardians that went by manifold names depending on the time and region and were said to be from another dimension\u2014a perfect world. He collected anything on Watchers, Keepers, Guides, Masters, Observers.\nVittorio\u2019s research revealed these guardians acted as gatekeepers of advanced and arcane knowledge that would gradually help humanity transcend to a higher plane of existence. He theorized the Observers waited for humanity to acquire wisdom before releasing knowledge that otherwise would lead to their self-destruction. Slowly, these Observers found ways to inspire humanity with knowledge that would stimulate growth, understanding and collective wisdom.\nVittorio adopted his Uncle Renzo\u2019s view that greed for money and power was the source of all conflict. His hope was that the lost knowledge of these gatekeepers might bring peace, harmony, and order to a violent world.\nAt Vittorio\u2019s urging, Renzo mounted an expedition to find lost relics and artifacts from the ruins of antiquity. In Hungary, they discovered a bronze dodecahedron that dated back to Roman times. In Asia minor, they uncovered a hidden tunnel beneath the Obelisk of Theodosius where they discovered stone tablets engraved in Akkadian cuneiform.\nThey told the tale of a mysterious artifact split into three and scattered across the world.\nA clue led them to the ruins of Troy where a secret chamber revealed a treasure trove of antiquities. The most precious was a piece of that mysterious artifact. Another clue led them to Isle of Rhodes where a hidden cave held a second part of that same relic. In Delphi, under the Temple of Apollo, Vittorio discovered the third piece on a black marble altar. Engravings on the altar showed a map of Crete and a star over the Palace of Minos.\nDeep in the labyrinth below the ruins of the palace, Vittorio discovered a place to put the key created by the three relics. Ancient machinery came to life. A stone wall slid open, revealing a hidden vault.\nRenzo and Vittorio entered and found a white marble wall inscribed with what seemed to be a form of Sanskrit. The message warned of a cult that sought to corrupt humanity with knowledge it wasn\u2019t ready for. They had hunted down the Observers and imprisoned them. But before being imprisoned, the Observers had hidden artifacts around the world with secret knowledge about this dark force and how to stop it from destroying the world.\nThe message on the wall also spoke of a stone from an ancient school that held the secrets of traveling between planes of existence. Vittorio, believing the stone held the key to finding the Observers or their perfect world, called the stone \u2018Lapis Paradisus.\u2019\nAs they exited the vault, Renzo stepped on a black serpent. The serpent sank its fangs into Renzo\u2019s leg and disappeared as quickly as it appeared. The venom spread fast and within minutes he passed away. As Renzo\u2019s only heir, Vittorio inherited his estate, his library, his title, and his vast fortune. Determined to honor his uncle and help humanity transcend its weakness, greed, and cruelty, he knew he had to find the Lapis Paradisus and free the Observers if they were still alive.\nIn 1391, Vittorio mounted an expedition. He employed a mercenary knight to aid in the effort and offer protection. Formerly a member of the Guardia Compagnia, Tarhos Kov\u00e1cs feared no man or beast. Vittorio\u2019s explorations and discoveries eventually led them to the heavily guarded catacombs beneath the Portuguese city of Sintra. If the expedition wanted to enter, they would have to kill those who guarded it. Vittorio had no wish to shed blood and told Tarhos to find another way.\nTarhos defied Vittorio and by the end of the day had him in irons.\nWhen they returned to Italy, Tarhos locked Vittorio in a dungeon and began a campaign of torture in Portoscuro, promising to stop when he revealed the meaning behind the stone.\nWithin weeks, Tarhos grew tired of torturing the townsfolk, and Vittorio was left to rot in the dungeon with no one to talk to but the rats. In his solitude he scratched the symbols from the Lapis Paradisus into the stone floor. He attempted countless sequences while imagining a world like paradise. And just when he was about to surrender to hunger and despair, he tried one last sequence while meditating on a world of endless peace and compassion.\nAt first, he thought he had failed. He gasped with the last of his strength as the rats approached menacingly, preparing to feast on his defeated, sallow flesh. Then, suddenly, a cold, unnatural, black fog rose from the stone floor and within moments he heard cries of anguish and crows circling above him. With difficulty he clambered to his feet and found himself in another world\u2014\nNot the paradise he had expected.\n", "row": 9, "column": 2}, {"name": "Thalita Lyra", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/ThalitaLyra.png", "overview": "Thalita Lyra has mastered the art of competitive flair, fighting kites with skill and flourish.\nHer personal Perks, Friendly Competition, Teamwork: Power of Two, and Cut Loose, allow her to perform a series of stealthy fast vaults, inspire faster repairs from teammates, and help allies move faster after they are healed by you.\nIf you were to ask, Thalita Lyra would tell you that what she wanted in life more than anything was to bring people together.

Her uncle Inacio taught Thalita and her younger brother, Renato, to settle their petty squabbles through making kites and flying them into each other until someone\u2019s string is cut and a winner is decided. Thalita and Renato would spend their summers at Inacio\u2019s beachfront kite shop, working in the mornings, and fighting kites in the afternoon. Their antics caught the attention of kids and adults alike, and it wasn\u2019t long before Thalita started teaching kite-fighting at the shop.

Fame, it seemed, was not as glamourous as she thought it would be. Late nights talking with Renato helped her realize what it was she was missing: connection. Genuine connection with like-minded people. That is how her father and mother drew people to them. And kite-fighting was what connected Thalita with others.\nWithin a few short months, Thalita had quit modelling, used her money to open her own shop \u2013 with Inacio\u2019s blessing, of course \u2013 and brought Renato on as her business partner. Fun Kites Rio became the premiere destination for kite-fighting materials, and Thalita\u2019s fame helped attract even more people to the hobby.\nIt was a great start, but Thalita, as always, wanted to reach even more people.\nFun Kites Rio\u2019s first tournament was a success, drawing hundreds of participants to the outskirts of Rio to watch dozens upon dozens of kites danced in the sky. In between socializing with old and new friends, helping at the concession stands, and even playing a match or two, Thalita found a few moments to cry happy tears by herself.\nShe had done it. This was exactly the community she wanted to create.\nBy the time the sun set and the tournament came to a close, the field was covered in litter. Thalita and Renato stayed behind to clean up. The full moon was high in the sky when Renato noticed something: a strange drone floating over the field.\nThalita\u2019s mischievous childhood self came roaring back. Time for a challenge: a race to take down the drone. Renato couldn\u2019t help but accept.\nIn the end, Thalita\u2019s kite was the one to get caught in the drone\u2019s rotor blades. She cheered as Renato watched the thing sputter into the forest, leaving a trail of smoke in its wake.\nThalita didn\u2019t want to look for the fallen drone. She was happy to leave her kite behind. But Renato walked off to the trees on his own, and Thalita couldn\u2019t let her brother wander the dark forest by himself.\nDeep in the woods, Renato found more than just the drone. Thalita heard a scream and watched as a man drenched in blood emerged from the forest. He grabbed her brother, desperate for help, but it was already too late. Thalita nearly screamed as the man split in two and a woman stepped forward, covered in high-tech hunting gear.\nWhy wasn\u2019t Renato moving?\nShe grabbed her brother and ran. Another drone floated overhead, like the one she had downed with her kite. They were the hunter\u2019s eyes, and she had plucked one of them from the sky.\nRenato was in shock, and Thalita saw that his arm had been cut deeply. When? It didn\u2019t matter. He was bleeding, and they needed to get to safety. That was when she saw the factory. A rotting brick building, collapsing under the weight of time.\nThalita led Renato into the factory and found a dark alcove to hide. The hunter followed, and she dragged some wooden beams across the entrance. The only way out, blocked off. Thalita knew time was running out. If the hunter didn\u2019t find them first, her drone would.\nThalita peeked from their alcove. The factory was changing, its dark and dingy walls dissolving to a bright and sunny landscape.\nA beach.\nShe found her resolve. A way out. A chance to survive. All she had to do was run.\nThalita put her arm around Renato and pulled him to his feet. She thought she heard Renato telling her to stop, but she ignored him. This was their chance. They ran along the beach, leaving the hunter behind, kicking up warm sand with each stride.\nThalita never stopped running, not even when the sand turned into swirling black fog.\n", "row": 9, "column": 3}, {"name": "Renato Lyra", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/RenatoLyra.png", "overview": "Renato Lyra always keeps his eyes on the prize, and he expects the same from his teammates.\nHis personal Perks, Blood Rush, Teamwork: Collective Stealth, and Background Player, allow him to move faster when near a chase, recover from Exhaustion instantly, and hide his and an allie's Scratch Marks after healing.\nGrowing up, Renato acted less like a child and more like a scientist, studying the world and people around him. He would poke classmates in the face or stand too close to them, curious to see their reaction.\nIt was no surprise that young Renato had a hard time making friends. He was often the target of bullies, especially when he started advancing through school. Sitting in classes with kids a year or two older than him \u2013 and still outperforming them \u2013 did not ingratiate Renato with his peers.\nRenato enjoyed two things: solving puzzles and annoying his older sister, Thalita. It was his way of showing his love. Renato saw how easily Thalita won over kids and adults alike and wanted to be like her. So, when Thalita started to take an interest in flying kites, Renato did too.\nHis parents knew Renato needed help socialising. When he turned thirteen, they volunteered Renato to work at Uncle Inacio\u2019s kite shop on the beach during the summer. Thalita was making new friends there, maybe he would too. Instead, Thalita spent the day telling Renato what to do, which annoyed him more than anything. The bickering got so bad that Uncle Inacio had to teach them the art of kite-fighting to settle their differences.\nRenato loved it immediately.\nHe enjoyed kite-fighting so much, he didn\u2019t even mind when he lost. As Inacio expected, they started to fight less and play more.\nIf only Renato had such luck with other people. Thalita would tell him to stop being so competitive with the kids they were teaching to kite-fight, but Renato wouldn\u2019t listen. He hated it when anyone told him what to do. When Thalita started spending less time at the shop to focus on her modeling, Renato had to step up as teacher. More than anything, he would hear how much everyone missed his sister.\nRenato graduated from high school two years early, and his parents suggested he take some time to do charitable work. University, or an early career, could wait. Renato just wanted to be left alone and treated like an adult. Thalita suggested that Renato find a place to play guitar \u2013 if he could practice his guitar-playing and put himself out there, Thalita promised the family would finally stop telling him what to do all the time.\nThat was music to his ears.\nRenato decided to volunteer at a local retirement home. First, he played guitar for the residents, then he started helping out in the kitchen, and before he knew it, Renato was learning what it meant to truly care about other people. To make the effort to help others without getting anything in return. For the first time, Renato felt like he had the power to make other people\u2019s lives better.\nThis new insight came in handy when Thalita was at a crossroads of her own. She wanted to pursue modelling and acting, but she missed the kite shop more than anything else. Renato didn\u2019t do more than listen when Thalita needed someone to talk to, but after many late nights and long chats, Thalita emerged with a new sense of purpose.\nWhen Thalita approached him to be a partner in her new venture, a kite-fighting shop called Fun Kites Rio, Renato accepted immediately. Building a business from scratch would be the ultimate puzzle.\nRenato\u2019s analytical mind helped the shop in those early months. He encouraged Thalita to use her fame as a model to help market the shop and booked her into conventions and symposiums across the country to get the word out on Fun Kites Rio. Over time, the shop built up such a following that when Thalita suggested they stage a kite-fighting tournament, it seemed like a no-brainer.\nThe tournament was a flurry of activity. All day, friends and strangers alike would approach Renato and thank him for his hard work. Kite-fighting meant something to these people, it made their lives better, and Renato contributed to their overall happiness and well-being.\nBefore he knew it, the tournament was over and the moon was high in the sky. It didn\u2019t matter that he was tired or hungry or out in some remote field picking up garbage. It was all worth it.\nHe only stopped cleaning when he noticed something up above: a drone. It made him think of the games he\u2019d play with Thalita growing up, using their kites to take down remote airplanes, kites of people on the beach they didn\u2019t like, and so on. Thalita must have been thinking the same thing. She challenged him to see who could take down the drone. Another chance to show up his sister. The perfect end to the perfect day.\nBut, no. This was a mistake. Renato felt a chill. He tried to stop Thalita, but she was already cheering. The drone ate up her kite and began its crooked, smoking descent into the forest.\nThey were in trouble. It was only when he ran for the forest that Thalita sobered up and followed.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find the drone imbedded in a tree, kite dangling from its dead rotor blades. The sharp string dug into Renato\u2019s fingers as he worked the knots, he nearly had the kite free when \u2013\n\u2013 a bloody hand reached out from the dark forest and grabbed him!\nRenato jumped at the sight of the injured man. He was raving, babbling, desperate for help. Renato put his hands out to keep the man from falling. It was already too late.\nTwo blades sliced through the man and along Renato\u2019s arm. There was no time to look down at the wound. The blades were up in the air. The man was cut in half. And a woman, clad in armor, accompanied by a drone \u2013 like the drone Thalita downed \u2013 was standing before him.\nRenato knew he had to move but he couldn\u2019t. Time was running out. Then he felt another hand on him, pulling him back.\nEverything was a blur. The cut in his arm was deep and throbbing. But he knew Thalita had him. And he knew he had to run.\nThe night grew cold as they stopped to hide. Renato struggled to regain his breath, but there was no time. As quickly as they stopped, Thalita was pulling him again, towards an abandoned factory.\nBut there are no factories out here, Renato thought to himself.\nThe factory was even colder than the forest. He clutched his arm, trying to stop the bleeding. His head was swimming. How much blood had he lost already? Thalita was guarding him in some dark corner of the factory, and suddenly \u2013\n\u2013 She was pulling Renato to his feet, telling him to run.\nRun where? She said something about a beach. Renato tried to stop her, tried pulling her back, but he was too weak. He couldn\u2019t see any beach. All he could see was black fog closing in on them.\n", "row": 9, "column": 4}, {"name": "Gabriel Soma", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/GabrielSoma.png", "overview": "Gabriel Soma is a resourceful engineer, ready to make the most out of any situation.\nHis personal Perks, Troubleshooter, Made for This, and Scavenger, help him see things during a Chase, gain Endurance after healing Survivors, and recharge his Toolbox.\n", "row": 10, "column": 1}, {"name": "Nicolas Cage", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/NicolasCage.png", "overview": "Nicolas Cage is a superstar, trapped in the role of a lifetime.\nHis personal Perks, Dramaturgy, Scene Partner, and Plot Twist, help him make a quick escape, see the Killer's Aura, and pretend to be dying.\n", "row": 10, "column": 2}, {"name": "Ellen Ripley", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/EllenRipley.png", "overview": "Ellen Ripley, Warrant Officer of the Nostromo, is capable and pragmatic.\nHer personal Perks, Chemical Trap, Light-Footed, and Lucky Star, let her hide her pools of blood and grunts of pain, slow Killers with trapped Pallets, and run silently.\n", "row": 10, "column": 3}, {"name": "Alan Wake", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/AlanWake.png", "overview": "Alan Wake, bestselling author, knows what it means to push back the darkness.\nHis personal Perks, Champion of Light, Boon: Illumination, and Deadline, make Flashlights more powerful, reveal chests and generators, and create more frequent Skill Checks.\n", "row": 10, "column": 4}, {"name": "Sable Ward", "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GregorioFornetti/Projeto-dbd-roleta/main/data/survivors/icons/SableWard.png", "overview": "Sable Ward is not afraid to embrace the darkness, or the power that lies within it.\nHer personal Perks, Invocation: Weaving Spiders, Strength in Shadows, and Wicked, allow her to quicken Repair progress, heal herself without a Med-Kit, and gain benefits from some Status Effects.\n", "row": 11, "column": 1}]
